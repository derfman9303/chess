# chess AI

This is my chess AI personal project, built entirely with regular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At its core it uses an algorithm called mini-max to iterate through all possible moves to a specified depth, and selecting the move which leads to the best outcome for itself by simulating the player making the best move for themself on their turn. Without any other strategies programmed in, you'll notice that this simple algorithm enables the AI to play surprisingly well and might catch you off-guard with some good moves.

Please feel free to look at my code and if you would like, you can download it and run it in your browser for yourself. Otherwise I have it hosted online at https://chess-js.fly.dev/

This is still a work in progress, so please ignore anything that's broken and if you would like, you should be able to submit an issue here on Github and I'll take a look at it.
